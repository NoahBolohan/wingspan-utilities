# Wingspan Utilities

Some utilities to support playing the Wingspan board game. Includes:

- **Automa tracker:** Simulate all of the Automa's actions and functionality in a game versus the Automa. Using this tool requires only the physical components the player uses (i.e., you no longer use the Automa cards, the End-of-round Goal Scoring cards, or the Current Round Tracker, or action cubes).
- **Score sheet (Automa):** Digital score sheet for games versus the Automa. Scores can be submitted to the Google Sheets document.
- **Score sheet:** Digital score sheet for games of 2 to 7 players. Scores can be submitted to the Google Sheets document.

The web app can be found [here](https://wingspan-utilities-vd2qp.ondigitalocean.app/).
